** Printer configuration and calibration

*** Bed leveling howto
1. Check in printer.cfg that
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ sed -n -E '/\[stepper_z\]|#\*# \[stepper_z\]/,/^$|#\*#/ p' printer_data/config/printer.cfg
   #+END_SRC
   With a result similar to following:
   #+attr_html: :width 50%
   #+attr_latex: :width 50%
   [[file:3D_printing/endstop_search_result.jpg][file:3D_printing/endstop_search_result.jpg]]

   Is set exactly one time and is zero. In example above you can delete
   autogenerated (#*#) value. And uncomment direct setup in stepper_z section.
   Afte all changes done, make printer re-read config, usually resetting it will
   do the trick.
2. Return head home by all the axis(X,Y,Z)
3. Warm up printer nozzle.
   #+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border
   | Name   | Temp |
   |--------+------|
   | Nozzle |  225 |
   | Bed    |   70 |
4. Clean up nozzle from any risidual fillament. Better to do on heated nozzle,
   else plastic is hard to get rid of.
5. Get yourself a fine feeler gauge. Like this one:
   #+attr_html: :width 50%
   #+attr_latex: :width 50%
   [[file:3D_printing/feeler_gauge.jpg][file:3D_printing/feeler_gauge.jpg]]

   Use one of the feelers, 0.2mm in this example.
6. Change Z offset to a filler size, in example it will be 0.2mm. Save
   configuration and reset printer.
7. Take any equally distant points on a bed, they will be used for measurement.
   Move head to designated points and make sure that feeler gauge with choosen
   size is able to squeeze between nozzle and bed. Adjust bed screws if
   neccessary. You should feel some resistance when pushing feeler between
   nozzle and bed.

   Repeat this procedure multiple times for all 4 choosen points, because one
   adjustemnt sequencially changes other's alignment. Do untill you will be
   satisfied with results for all 4 points.

   Nota bene: On working printer it is adviced to move head issuing proper
   commands to it.
8. Return head to HOME
9. Run command
   #+BEGIN_SRC txt
   BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
   #+END_SRC
   Using interface and feeler gauge calibrate bed mesh. There will be multiple
   points probed by macros, after that algorith, will build Z adjustmant
   map. Keep in mind that if you fall out of coordinates(go beyond available Z
   positions procedure will be aborted by algorithm).

   Interface:
   #+attr_html: :width 50%
   #+attr_latex: :width 50%
   [[file:3D_printing/bed_mesh.jpg][file:3D_printing/bed_mesh.jpg]]


   You can look at restulting map in klipper interface:
   #+attr_html: :width 50%
   #+attr_latex: :width 50%
   [[file:3D_printing/mesh_map.jpg][file:3D_printing/mesh_map.jpg]]

   When done and map looks good, issue command
   #+BEGIN_SRC
     SAVE_CONFIG
   #+END_SRC
   To save config.
*** Calibrate retractions
Best to use special tool:

https://k3d.tech/calibrations/retractions/rct.html

There is a link to a detailed how-to on tool usage:

*** Linear advance calbiration
Then again, a special tool to use:
