1. Remove the skid plate – 3 5mm allen/hex bits – 2 underneath towards the front
   of the plate and 1 on the left side near the foot beg. From there it slides
   off a small rail on the right side. Mind the little cylinder/spacer and
   rubber grommet included on the side bolt.
2. Remove drain bolts – there are TWO of them. Both 12mm. Remove in any
   order. Make sure oil pan is under both. Rock bike back and forth on center
   stand to get all the oil out.
3. Replace drain bolts. Check the crush washers and replace if
   worn/damaged. Torque for the two 12mm bolts is 22 ft-lbs.
4. Remove the old oil filter. If using the K&N, a 17mm wrench is handy to remove
   the filter. Make sure the oil drain pain is below the filter, more oil will
   come out.
5. Replace the oil filter. Like I said, I like the K&N filters with the nut on
   the end. Makes removal so much easier (do NOT use nut on end for
   install). Part number is KN-204. Honda OEM part number (for reference, if
   desired) is 15410-MFJD01.
6. Lubricate the oil filter gasket by using some fresh oil on your
   finger. Torque for oil filter is 19 ft-lbs.
7. Refill oil. Remove the oil fill plug and use funnel to pour oil in. 4.3
   quarts of oil is needed for the manual AT, 4.4 for the DCT. (if just changing
   oil – no filter – volume is 4.1 quarts for manual and 4.2 quarts for DCT).
8. After warming up the bike again put bike back on center stand. Check for
   leaks. Remove the dipstick and wipe it clean. Insert the dipstick until it
   seats but don’t screw it in. Check that the oil level is between the upper
   and lower level marks. Replace dipstick and screw back in till snug.
9. Replace skid plate.
