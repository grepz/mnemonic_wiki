** Flashing discovery board
You'll need to isolate the microcontroller from the st-link portion of the
board. To do this just remove the jumpers on the CN3 pins.

Then, to use your external st-link, make the following connections to the
microconroller pin headers:

    SWDIO -> PA13
    SWCLK -> PA14
    GND -> GND

    VAPP -> 3V/VDD

    Do not connect the USB cable

Program it in SW mode.

Not sure why you'd want to do this, unless you wanted to use JTAG to program it
instead. If that's the case let me know and I'll update the answer.
